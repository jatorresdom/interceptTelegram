# Telegram Bot Interceptor: A Tutorial

## Introduction

This tutorial demonstrates how to create a Telegram bot interceptor to capture and log messages sent to a bot. The purpose is to understand potential vulnerabilities in Telegram bots and highlight the importance of securing bot tokens. Additionally, we explore scenarios where bot tokens could be leaked and the associated dangers.

## Prerequisites

1. **Install Python Libraries**:
   - Use the following command to install the required libraries:
     ```bash
     pip install python-telegram-bot telethon
     ```
2. **Set Up a Telegram Bot**:
   - Create a bot using [BotFather](https://t.me/BotFather) on Telegram and obtain its bot token.
3. **Obtain Telegram API Credentials**:
   - Visit the [Telegram Developer Portal](https://my.telegram.org/) to obtain your `api_id` and `api_hash`.

## Step 1: Set Up the Interceptor

The interceptor script listens for messages sent to the bot and logs them to the console.
